Welcome to the Waste Management App, your go-to solution in the quest for efficient and eco-friendly waste handling! 🚀

Our app is not just about managing waste, it's about creating a sustainable future, one notification at a time. Here's what we offer:

1. 📅 **Waste Collection Reminders:**
    - Say goodbye to forgotten collection days! Our intuitive dashboard allows you to input your address and receive real-time reminders. Whether it's the Grüne Tonne or Gelbe Tonne, our timely notifications ensure your bins are always ready.
    - Our calendar view not only highlights upcoming collection days, but also allows you to set preferences (like reminders for the evening before). No more last-minute scrambles or debates about who should have remembered the trash!

2. 👥 **Community Interaction:**
    - Be part of a green revolution! Users can upload and rate waste collection schedules, ensuring the highest level of accuracy and reliability.
    - Customize existing schedules and actively contribute to your communities.

Join us in building a community-driven resource that's making a real difference. Together, we can create a cleaner, greener world - one bin at a time! 🌳
